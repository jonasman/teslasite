# Change log

### Climate (Model 3)

You can focus air from the vents onto one area, or pinch to split the airflow. The 3D
visualization of the dashboard has been tuned to more clearly display airflow in the
center region. To allow for more precision, you can now drag the air to the desired 
area instead of tapping.

### Cold weather improvements (Model 3)

Window position and charge connector locking behaviors have been optimized for cold weather.

### Mobile access 

For additional security, your Tesla username and password will be required when disabling mobile access. To adjust the car’s mobile access setting, go to Controls > Safety > Allow Mobile Access

<i>This release contains minor improvements and bug fixes</i>
