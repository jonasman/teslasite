### Automatic Emergency Braking Autopark: Parallel Parking Summon 

With this release we're introducing a new safety feature, Automatic Emergency Braking.Automatic Emergency Braking, a new Collision Avoidance Assist feature, is designed to automatically engage the brakes to reduce the impact of an unavoidable frontal collision with another vehicle. The brakes disengage when you press hard on the accelerator pedal, release the brake pedal, or sharply turn the steering wheel.Automatic Emergency Braking is enabled by default. You can temporarily disable it by tapping CONTROLS > Settings > Driver Assistance > COLLISION AVOIDANCE ASSIST, and then disabling the AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING setting. The feature is re-enabled on your next drive.
