To increase security, a new setting has been added that allows you to prevent your vehicle from being driven until a 4-digit PIN has been entered. To enable this setting, tap Controls > Safety & Security > PIN to Drive on the touchscreen then create your PIN. Note that the same PIN must be entered in order to drive the vehicle or change the setting.
