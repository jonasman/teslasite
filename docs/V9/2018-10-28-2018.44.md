With this release, Model 3 can be summoned in and out of narrow parking spaces using the mobile app. To enable this feature, tap Controls > Autopilot > Summon. To learn how to initiate, cancel, and customize Summon, refer to the Ownerâ€™s Manual.

### Climate  - Model 3

{: .fs-1 }

You can focus air from the vents onto one area, or pinch to split the airflow. The 3D visualization of the dashboard has been tuned to more clearly display airflow in the center region. To allow for more precision, you can now drag the air to the desired area instead of tapping.

### Mobile Access  - Model S, Model X, Model 3
